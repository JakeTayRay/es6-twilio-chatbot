A chatbot written in es6 and vs6 for twilio and testing on the web. The important files are index.js and game.js.

A popular theme for the upcoming Halloween holiday is to make haunted house simulations. You will make a choose your own adventure for a haunted house presented as a Twilio chatbot. 

To run this you can visit the heroku site - https://chatbot-jtaylorray4223.herokuapp.com/

If you would prefer to build this yourself, you just need to download the folder and run two commands in your terminal:

npm install

npm run start

This will install the node packages needed to make the project run, and the npm run start will start the local host instance for you to
then start the program.
